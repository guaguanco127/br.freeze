## <a name="About"></a>About

This is a spectral Max/MSP abstraction, and Ableton Max for Live device that allows the user to do a spectral freeze of a stereo signal. Additionally, a transient detector option is available. 

Currently works in any sample rate or bit depth.

Only works as an abstraction or a device. External objects and RNBO not available yet. An extremely important file is included in each folder called "solofreeze.pfft" do not move or delete this file until you follow all instructions for installation. 
  
**Freeze:** On/Off, Bypass or Freeze.  
**Retrigger:** When the freeze is on, this will freeze the current stereo signal.  
**Mix Modes:** "Insert" interrupts the signal with the freeze, while "Gate" only allows the freeze to sound without passing through the dry signal during bypass.    
**Transient Detect:** When both "Freeze" and "Transient Detect" are on, the freeze will occur automatically based on the transient detection sensitivity settings. Detections cannot occur faster than 100 ms.   
**Transient Detect Sensitivity:** When both "Freeze" and "Transient Detect" are on, this will determine how sensitive the transient detection is. Between 0. and 1., 0. is the lowest sensitivity, while 1. is the most sensitive.
